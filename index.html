                       Fixture is a cross-platform free and open source raster graphics editor. It is inspired by the need for having an equivalent of Adobe Photoshop on Linux-based platforms. 
                      <br/>Fixture aims to be solid enough for season veterans , quick enough for amateur graphic artists and easy for new users to learn. It can be ported to any of your favorite operating systems that supports Qt. And it's free!
                      <p>
                      The  project is <a href="https://github.com/eyeon/Fixture">hosted at github</a> and is based on Qt 5.11 on C++.

We are a bunch of opionated developers that came together to build something useful and fun. We believe in having an open environment to work on and share ideas and fix the problems we, as users, face in everyday life because some company won't do something in a way if that doesn't bring them enough cash. We are the people, curating solutions for the people.
